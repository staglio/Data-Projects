# COVID-19 Impact Analysis & Global Happiness Context

## Overview
This project presents an exploratory data analysis of the global impact of COVID-19 using confirmed cases and deaths data aggregated at the country level. The analysis is enriched by integrating the World Happiness Report to explore how pandemic outcomes relate to socio-economic and well-being indicators.

The project is designed as an **end-to-end data analysis portfolio project**, focusing on data cleaning, aggregation, visualization, and responsible interpretation of results.

## Objectives
- Clean and aggregate COVID-19 time-series data to country-level metrics  
- Identify the most affected countries by confirmed cases and deaths  
- Integrate COVID-19 data with the World Happiness Report  
- Explore correlations between pandemic impact and well-being indicators  
- Communicate insights clearly while avoiding causal overclaims  

---

## Datasets
- **COVID-19 Confirmed Cases** – cumulative time-series data by country  
- **COVID-19 Deaths** – cumulative time-series data by country  
- **World Happiness Report** – country-level socio-economic and well-being indicators  

---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas  
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Key Insights
- COVID-19 impact is highly uneven across countries, with a small number accounting for a large share of global cases and deaths  
- Countries with stronger reporting and healthcare infrastructure often show higher confirmed case counts  
- Correlations between COVID-19 metrics and happiness indicators are **complex and non-causal**, highlighting the importance of contextual interpretation  

---

## Limitations
- Metrics are based on **absolute counts**, not normalized by population  
- Analysis is performed at the country level and does not capture regional variation  
- Differences in testing capacity and reporting standards affect data comparability  
- Correlation does not imply causation
